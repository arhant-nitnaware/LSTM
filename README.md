# LSTM
LSTM-Based Models for Sequential Data
What is an LSTM?
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. Traditional RNNs struggle with vanishing gradients when dealing with long sequences. LSTMs overcome this using memory cells and gating mechanisms to selectively retain or discard information.

Key Components:

Input Gate: Controls how much of the input is passed to the memory.

Forget Gate: Decides what information to discard from the previous cell state.

Output Gate: Determines the next hidden state from the cell state.

LSTMs are highly effective in tasks involving:

Time series forecasting

Natural language processing

Speech recognition

Music generation


Time Series Forecasting using LSTM
Objective:
To predict future values in a univariate time series dataset using LSTM models.

Theory:
In time series forecasting, we predict the next values based on previous observations. LSTMs are well-suited for this because they can capture temporal dependencies in sequences, such as trends and seasonality.

Process:
Normalize the data (MinMaxScaler)

Create sequences of time steps (sliding window)

Split into train/test

Define and train the LSTM model

Predict and compare with actual values


Sequence Text Prediction using LSTM
Objective:
To auto-generate the next characters or words in a sequence using LSTM models.

Theory:
Sequence prediction is a generative task where the model learns the patterns in text and generates the most likely next item (character or word). LSTMs are ideal because they can model dependencies over long sequences.

Applications:
Text autocompletion

Chatbots

Creative writing (e.g., story generation)

Process:
Clean and tokenize text

Create input-output pairs using sliding windows

One-hot encode or embed tokens

Train LSTM model on sequence data

Generate new sequences by feeding the modelâ€™s output back as input
